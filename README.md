- OpenAI API key (for AI features)
- Screen Recording Permission for Terminal/IDE
  - On macOS:
    1. Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Screen Recording
    2. Ensure your Terminal app (or IDE) has screen recording permission enabled
    3. Restart your Terminal/IDE after enabling permissions
  - On Windows:
    - No additional permissions needed
  - On Linux:
    - May require `xhost` access depending on your distribution

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ibttf/interview-coder.git
cd interview-coder
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or if using bun
bun install
```

## Running Locally

1. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run app:dev
# or
bun run app:dev
```

This will:

- Start the Vite development server
- Launch the Electron application
- Enable hot-reloading for development

## Tech Stack

- Electron
- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Radix UI Components
- OpenAI API

## Configuration

1. On first launch, you'll need to provide your OpenAI API key
2. The application will store your settings locally using electron-store

## Building (for Roy)

notarizing script is wack asf, we have an auto code signing in the package.json, but we need to manually notarize

```
xcrun notarytool store-credentials "my-apple-creds" \
  --apple-id "YOUR_APPLE_ID@example.com" \
  --team-id "YOUR_TEAM_ID" \
  --password "XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX"
```

run that ^ and then cd into release and run

```


#intel
arch -arm64 xcrun notarytool submit "/Users/roylee0912/Development/interview-coder/release/Interview Coder-1.0.0.dmg" \
  --keychain-profile "my-apple-creds" \
  --wait


#silicon
arch -arm64 xcrun notarytool submit "/Users/roylee0912/Development/interview-coder/release/Interview Coder-1.0.0-arm64.dmg" \
  --keychain-profile "my-apple-creds" \
  --wait



xcrun stapler staple "Interview Coder-1.0.0.dmg"


xcrun stapler staple "Interview Coder-1.0.0-arm64.dmg"
